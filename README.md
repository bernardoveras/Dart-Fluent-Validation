# Fluent Validation

This is a port of the C# variant as can be seen at [This Link](https://fluentvalidation.net/)

The goal with this was to decouple the UI validation as seen in Flutters TextFields and use a more common and readable standard. It is still very much beta so please give it a go and give me your feedback.

```dart
class UserValidator extends AbstractValidator<User> {
	UserValidator() {
		ruleFor((user) => user.age).isNotNull().greaterThanOrEqual(13);
		ruleFor((user) => user.name).isNotEmpty();
	}
}

// Later on
final UserValidator validator = UserValidator();
ValidationResult result = validator.validate(user);
```

## Features

1. Built in validators (Most included, as well as some extra ones)
2. Custom validators (Only supported through the 'must' matcher at the moment)
3. Localisation (Not done yet)

## Built in Validators

- isNull - (checks the object is null)
- isNotNull - (checks the object is not null)
- notEmpty - (checks the object is a String and not empty)
- empty - (checks the object is a String and is empty)
- notEqual - (checks if an object is not equal to another)
- equal - (checks if an object is equal to another)
- length - (checks the object is a String and is between two other numbers)
- minLength - (checks the object is a String and is of a minimum length)
- maxLength - (checks the object is a String and is at least of a maximum length)
- lessThan - (checks the object is a number and is less than another number)
- lessThanOrEqual - (checks the object is a number and is less than or equal to another number)
- greaterThan - (checks the object is a number and is greater than another number)
- greaterThanOrEqual - (checks the object is a number and is greater than or equal to another number)

## Extra Built In Validators

These are not included in the default C# version.
